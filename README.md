# PatientHealthcareMobileAppFYP
 It is a Final Year Project which I have done during my Bachelorâ€™s Degree with University of London (UOL). The purpose of the mobile app is to help patients to help keep track or manage health-related routines like appointments & reminders to take in medicines. It uses Google Flutter framework with Google Firebase backend service & Dart object-oriented language.
